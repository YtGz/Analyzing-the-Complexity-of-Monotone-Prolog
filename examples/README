This is a collection of all monotone programs from the Termination Problem Data Base (8.0.6) for which AProVE was able infer (upper) complexity bounds. 
The examples are taken from the following link:
http://aprove.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/eval/LPGraphs/report/complexity.html

Note that there are some duplicate programs.
